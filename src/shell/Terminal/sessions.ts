   The terminal panel's session list, as pure functions.

   Two places hold a list of terminals: the zustand store behind
   the docked panel, and the pop-out window's local state. Sharing
   the transitions rather than the container keeps "closing the
   active tab focuses its neighbour" from being written twice and
   drifting.

   A session carries the cwd and privilege it was SPAWNED with, not
   the ones the explorer currently points at. A shell you are typing
   in must not change directory because the file tree selection
   moved, and with several tabs open there is no single "current"
   directory to follow anyway.
