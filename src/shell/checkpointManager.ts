   sparkBook · src/shell/checkpointManager.ts

   One window's half of the checkpoint.

   Boot claims the previous run's window list, reopens the windows it
   names, and hands this window the project it should show. From then
   on a debounced mirror keeps the host's copy of the active project
   and of this window's row up to date.

   Three things this module is careful about, because a checkpoint
   that gets them wrong is worse than no checkpoint at all:

     · claim-once — `bootCheckpoint` is latched on a module promise, so
       StrictMode's double mount, or two callers racing, still produce
       exactly one claim and one set of windows. The host enforces the
       same thing across windows; this is the per-window half.

     · no writes after teardown — every scheduled write checks the
       generation it was scheduled in. A tick that was already queued
       when the window tore down finds a bumped generation and returns
       without touching the host.

     · nothing outlives the window — teardown clears the timer, drops
       every store subscription and removes every listener it added.
       There is no other state to release: geometry is read from the
       webview synchronously rather than through a Tauri listener, so
       there is no async unlisten to lose.
