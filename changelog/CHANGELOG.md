## [0.7.2] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **`Shift+Tab` was never an app shortcut — it was an unhandled key.** WebKitGTK's keyval table names `GDK_KEY_Tab` and `KP_Tab` but not `ISO_Left_Tab`, which is the keysym `Shift+Tab` produces, so the press arrived with `key: "Unidentified"` and only `code`/`keyCode` saying Tab. `encodeKey` dropped it as IME noise, so nothing was sent to the shell **and** nothing was cancelled — and the webview ran its own default for the key, moving focus to the previous tab stop. 0.7.1 read that as WebKitGTK ignoring `preventDefault`; the diagnosis was wrong. `keyOf` (`src/bridge/pty.ts`) maps the press back to `Tab`, `CSI Z` reaches the shell, and cancelling the keydown keeps the keyboard on the surface.
- **Focus is no longer yanked back after a key.** 0.7.1's recovery took the keyboard back on any blur within 150 ms of a handled keystroke, so typing a command and clicking straight into the editor left focus on the terminal. Gone with the tab-order suppression, whose `MutationObserver` also re-scanned the whole panel on every frame paint.
- **Popping the terminal out moves the shells.** The panel kept its sessions and respawned them the next time it opened, so every running program died in transit and both windows held shells. Running sessions are handed over live (`pty_adopt`) and keep running; an exited one is respawned in the new window.
- **A pop-out window closed from its title bar leaked its shells.** Destroying the webview unmounts nothing, so `pty_kill` was never called and each session held a pty, a writer thread and 5000 lines of scrollback until app exit. Sessions record their owning window and `shutdown_window` ends them on `Destroyed`.
- **Terminal sessions leaked across projects.** Switching or closing a project closed the document tabs but left the outgoing project's shells running, and the next autosave wrote them into the incoming project's snapshot.
- **`pty_write` no longer blocks the UI thread.** Sync Tauri commands run on the UI thread and a pty write blocks once the line discipline's input queue (~4 KB) is full, so pasting into a shell whose foreground program was not reading froze the window. Writes go through a per-session writer thread that preserves arrival order. `pty_kill`'s SIGHUP → grace → SIGKILL → `wait` moved off the UI thread too; it ran on every tab close, restart and root toggle.
- **A resize or scroll could blank the screen.** Frame sequence numbers were taken under the parser lock but emitted after releasing it, so a full repaint could be delivered behind a delta built after it. The renderer drops the lower `seq`, then applied the delta to a grid of the wrong shape. Build and emit now share one per-session lock.
- **"Open in Terminal" landed on dead tabs.** Session status moved from the panel's local state into the store, so `openAt` can tell a live shell from one that has exited.
- **A new terminal for a collapsed folder opened in its parent.** The cwd derivation only counted directories the tree had already listed; `directoryOf` (`src/store/explorer.ts`) also reads the parent listing's `isDir`, and the sidebar's terminal bubble shares it.
- **A restored-open terminal panel took the keyboard at startup**, off whatever the workspace restore had put in the editor.

### Added
- **Keyboard navigation in the terminal tab strip** — `←`/`→` between tabs, `Home`/`End` to the ends, `Delete` to close. With a roving `tabindex` and no arrow handling the inactive tabs were unreachable. Focus follows the tab that takes over when the focused one closes.

### Removed
- **The pop-out window's `terminal:cwd` / `spark:terminal:cwd` listeners.** Nothing emitted either event, and changing `cwd` never affected a running session.

---

## [0.7.1] — 2026-09-01

### Fixed
- **`Shift+Tab` took the keyboard out of the terminal.** Tab and Shift+Tab are focus-navigation keys to the engine before they are anything else, and WebKitGTK traverses on them even when the key press's default is cancelled: the bytes reached the shell, but focus landed on the panel's Restart button and the next keystroke went nowhere. While a shell holds the keyboard, nothing else inside the terminal panel or the pop-out window is a tab stop; a `MutationObserver` covers controls that appear while it is focused, and everything is restored on blur so the panel's controls stay keyboard-reachable when you are not typing into a shell.

---

## [0.7.0] — 2026-09-01

### Added
- **Terminal selection, in grid coordinates.** Drag to select with a highlight that follows the cell grid, double-click a word (paths and URLs count as one), triple-click a line, or **Select all** from a new right-click menu carrying Copy / Paste / Select all / Clear selection (`src/shell/Terminal/selection.ts`).
- **Mouse reports for full-screen programs.** Presses, drags and releases are encoded as xterm mouse reports (`encodeMouseButton`) and handed to any program that asked for them, in SGR or either legacy encoding. Holding Shift overrides the program and selects instead, as in every other terminal.
- **Clipboard bridge** (`src/bridge/clipboard.ts`) that prefers the Tauri clipboard plugin over `navigator.clipboard`, because WebKitGTK ships `writeText` but not `readText`, and falls back to `document.execCommand` where neither exists.

### Changed
- **Copy is `Ctrl+Shift+C` / `Ctrl+Insert` / the context menu; paste is `Ctrl+V`, `Ctrl+Shift+V`, `Shift+Insert`, middle-click or the menu.** `Ctrl+C` remains SIGINT.
- **The explorer resize drag no longer goes through React state.** The width is written onto the pane element while the pointer is down and committed once on release — it used to set state every frame, re-rendering the whole shell including the file tree, and write `localStorage` synchronously each time.
- **Terminal frames are listened to once per window** and fanned out by session id, rather than decoded once per open tab and discarded by an id check.
- **The frame pump blocks on a condition variable** instead of polling every 8ms for the life of each session.

### Fixed
- **Copy returned every line run together.** Rows and spans are absolutely positioned, so `window.getSelection().toString()` concatenated them with no separator and dropped the trailing blanks the host trims — three selected lines pasted as one. Text is rebuilt from the painted grid.
- **Paste was impossible from the keyboard.** `Ctrl+V` encoded `^V` (readline's quoted-insert) *and* called `preventDefault()`, suppressing the webview's own paste; `Ctrl+Shift+V` returned early into nothing.
- **The clipboard plugin had no permissions.** `clipboard-manager:default` grants none in Tauri v2, so the plugin was installed and unusable. `allow-read-text` and `allow-write-text` are now granted in `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`.
- **A click inside a TUI did nothing.** With mouse reporting on the surface declined to select and sent the program nothing, so menus and buttons were unreachable and there was no way to copy out of a full-screen program.
- **AltGr characters were ESC-prefixed.** X11 and Windows both report AltGr as ctrl+alt, so the `@` on a German layout arrived as `ESC @`. Also: IME composition was forwarded as well as composed (typing every candidate twice), modified function keys sent the unmodified sequence so `Shift+F3` silently did `F3`, and modified `Home`/`End`/`Delete`, `Alt+Enter`, `Alt+Backspace` and astral characters were mis-encoded.
- **A paste could escape bracketed paste.** An embedded `ESC[201~` ended paste mode early, so the remainder of the clipboard ran as typed input.
- **Exited sessions leaked.** A shell that ended stayed in the host's table for the life of the window, holding its pty file descriptor, its writer and a vt100 parser with 5000 lines of scrollback; `pty_list` reported shells that no longer ran. Killed children are now reaped on shutdown rather than left as zombies.
- **The explorer pane resized its boundary but not its contents.** `.sidebar` was pinned to `width: 260px` — the cross axis of a column flex container — so the contents stayed 260px wide wherever the handle was dragged.
- **"Show explorer" did nothing.** The reveal button sits inside the resize handle, whose pointerdown starts a drag and captures the pointer, retargeting everything after it away from the button.
- **Long file names ran past the explorer.** Tree rows lacked `min-width: 0`, so as flex items they refused to shrink below their text and pushed out of the pane instead of ellipsising. Indent is now capped against the row's own width, and the header wraps instead of crushing the folder name.
- **The pane could be dragged over the editor.** The clamp knew only `SIDEBAR_MAX`, not the window; `maxWidthFor` now reserves the plugin rail and 320px of editor.
- **The terminal took focus back** when the engine traverses away on `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` despite the key press's default being cancelled.

---

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-31

### Added
- **Projects.** A project is an opened folder — no naming step, and nothing written into your directories. Opening a folder creates or touches its record, and each project remembers its own tabs, tree and terminals. **File → Switch Project…** lists them, most-recent-first, with in-place rename and remove. The **Close Project** command clears the front project without losing its record.
- **Continue where you stopped.** On launch the most recently opened project is restored silently: its open tabs in order with their editor mode, caret and scroll offset; the active tab; the explorer root, expanded directories, hidden-file toggle and selection; terminal tabs at their previous working directory and privilege; and the terminal panel, sidebar and status-bar layout. Files deleted since last quit are dropped with one summary notification.
- **The empty state is about projects now.** "New document" is gone; the cards are **New project…**, **Switch project…** (with a count of remembered folders) and **Open file…**, over a **Recent projects** list showing each folder's path and how many tabs come back with it. With a project open the heading reads "No files open in <project>" rather than greeting you as a first-time user.
- **`projects.json`** in the app-data directory, holding all of the above (`src/store/projects.ts`). Documented in `docs/reference/projects-json.md`; up to 20 projects, 20 tabs each. Only paths are stored, never document contents.

### Changed
- **`Open Recent` is now `Open Recent File`** and actually opens the sidebar's Recents tab. It previously opened the *command* palette, which contains no files.
- **The splash screen stops naming a file that never existed** — its stages now read "reading projects.json…" and "restoring workspace…", over work that really happens. The splash also holds until restore has finished rather than dismissing on a timer alone.
- **The welcome wizard stands down for anyone who already has a project.** A returning user is not on a first run.
- **Terminal panel position and size moved into the terminal store**, so they can be restored per project — and so they survive a remount, which the old component-local ref could not.

### Fixed
- **sparkBook did not run in a browser at all.** `TitleBar`'s title-sync effect called `getCurrentWindow()` unguarded; outside Tauri that throws on `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__.metadata`, and the optional-call syntax could not catch it, so the whole shell crashed on mount under `npm run dev`. All four window calls are now gated on `isTauri`.
- **The titlebar close button skipped the unsaved-changes guard.** It called `window.close()` directly, so quitting that way — the ordinary way — bypassed the dirty-buffer prompt entirely. It now routes through the shell like every other close path, which is also what lets the final workspace snapshot be written.
- **Removed three dead bridge stubs** (`getAppState`, `setAppState`, `windowSetTitle`) that invoked Rust commands which were never implemented. They had no callers; any future one would have failed at runtime.

---

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **A terminal scrollbar** (`src/shell/Terminal/scroll.ts`, `TerminalView.tsx`) — draggable, sized from a new `scrollback_max` on the frame. vt100 exposes the scrollback *offset* but not the buffer's length, so `build_frame` probes it by asking for more than could exist and reading the clamp back. Rendered as an overlay in the host's 8px padding so it steals no column, and only when there is history to reach.
- **Keyboard viewport scrolling** — `Shift+PageUp`/`Shift+PageDown` page, `Shift+Home`/`Shift+End` jump to the ends. Bare `PageUp` still reaches the tty, because pagers and editors bind it themselves.
- **Frames carry terminal mode** — `alternate_screen`, `mouse_mode` and `mouse_encoding` (`src-tauri/src/pty.rs`), so the renderer can tell a shell from a full-screen program and route a wheel accordingly.

### Changed
- **The terminal takes focus when its tab comes to the front, or when it is clicked.** There was no `focus()` call anywhere in `TerminalView` or `TerminalPanel`, so keystrokes went nowhere until you clicked precisely on rendered text. Visibility is detected from the host box going from zero to sized, since inactive tabs are `hidden`.
- **Frame emission moved off the read loop** (`spawn_reader`) to a companion thread that flushes on an ~8ms interval.
- **Theme resolution uses an explicit `isDarkTheme` set** (`src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`) instead of `resolved !== "light"`, which called amber dark. A pre-paint script in `index.html` stamps `data-theme` from localStorage so the first frame is correct.
- **Scroll failures log once per session** instead of being swallowed by `.catch(() => {})`.

### Fixed
- **Scrolling did nothing inside a full-screen program.** A TUI runs in vt100's alternate screen, whose grid is constructed with zero scrollback, so `pty_scroll` was a guaranteed no-op — there was no history to move through. Real terminals hand the wheel to the program instead; Spark did neither. A wheel notch now becomes an xterm mouse report when the program turned mouse reporting on, arrow keys when the alternate screen is up without it (xterm's `alternateScroll`), or a viewport move otherwise.
- **The wheel ignored `deltaMode`.** Every event mapped to a fixed `±scrollRows`, so a trackpad's pixel deltas each moved three rows: one flick travelled hundreds of rows and fired a full-grid repaint per event. Pixel deltas now convert through the measured cell height, sub-row remainders accumulate, and one request is in flight at a time.
- **The host dropped the last frame of every output burst.** `spawn_reader` set `dirty` and emitted only when 8ms had elapsed, then blocked in `read()` — so the final chunk sat unpainted until the program wrote again. Output that stops halfway and completes on the next keypress.
- **The first prompt could be lost.** Frames arriving before `ptySpawn` resolved carried an id the renderer did not know yet and were discarded; everything after is a delta against rows the host already considers painted. `ptyRefresh` after spawn closes the window.
- **The theme provider could persist "system" over a real preference.** A window with empty localStorage — a fresh profile, cleared site data, or the pop-out terminal — wrote the store before the Tauri read of `settings.json` had resolved. Storage access is now wrapped throughout, since private mode makes it throw.

---

## [0.4.0] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Tabbed terminal sessions** — one tab per shell, a `+` to open another, close buttons and middle-click close (`src/shell/TerminalPanel.tsx`, `src/shell/Terminal/sessions.ts`, `src/store/terminal.ts`). Sessions stay mounted while hidden because `TerminalView` kills its pty on unmount. The list transitions are pure functions shared by the docked panel (zustand) and the pop-out window (local state). `New Terminal` joins the command palette.
- **Settings** — gear at the foot of the plugin rail, `Ctrl+,`, and the palette (`src/shell/Settings/SettingsDialog.tsx`, `src/store/settings.ts`). Appearance (theme, density, interface text scale), Editor (font size, tab size, word wrap, line numbers), Terminal (font size, line height, cursor style and blink, scroll step, default privilege, mobile preset). Persisted to `settings.json` through the Tauri store with a localStorage mirror and broadcast over the event bus so the pop-out window follows. Persisted values are validated on read, not trusted. `src/theme/density.css` carries the compact layout.
- **Mobile view** — a toggle in the docked panel and the pop-out that pins the terminal surface to a phone viewport, dimensions only. The pop-out resizes its OS window to match; needed `core:window:allow-set-size`, since `core:window:default` grants only the read side.

### Changed
- **A terminal session keeps the cwd and privilege it spawned with.** The panel used to follow the explorer selection and respawn the shell when it moved; with several tabs there is no single directory to follow, and a shell being typed in must not relocate. The explorer now decides where the *next* terminal starts. Privilege is per session.
- **Terminal tab names come from the cwd's last segment.** Shells title themselves `user@host: dir`, so truncation cut off the only part that distinguishes two tabs. Full path and shell title moved to the tooltip.
- **The pop-out terminal is parented to the main window** — transient-for on Linux, owner window on Windows, child window on macOS — so it stays above the editor instead of sinking behind it. Not `alwaysOnTop`.
- **Log levels** — Info in release, Debug in dev, with `notify`, `tao`, `wry`, `hyper` and `polling` pinned to Warn. `tauri_plugin_log::Builder::default()` was logging everything at TRACE to stdout and a 40 KB rotating file.
- **Removed** the "System terminal" button from the terminal panel footer.

### Fixed
- **Explorer file watcher took the app down on large projects** (`src-tauri/src/watch.rs`) — `watch_path` called `RecursiveMode::Recursive` with no filter and `notify` followed symlinks, so opening a Flutter project walked `.plugin_symlinks` into the pub cache: 35,400 directories watched where 248 are useful, each logged at TRACE. The host now walks the tree itself, skipping build/dependency/VCS directories, never descending a symlink (`DirEntry::file_type` does not resolve them), capping at 4096 directories and depth 12, and registering one non-recursive watch per surviving directory. New directories are picked up from their own create events. Flushes cap at 64 changes, past which a single `bulk` marker replaces thousands of IPC messages.
- **The settings sheet could not be moved, and laid out wrong.** It was centred with `transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`, which the entrance animation overwrites when it writes `transform` for its scale and slide; position and size are now real coordinates. Its title and description were two of three children in a grid declared for two rows, so the description absorbed the `1fr` and pushed the section list to the bottom of an empty sheet — they now share one header, which is also the drag handle.
- **Mobile panel width depended on how many tabs were open.** `width: auto` on a fixed-position box is shrink-to-fit, so the header and tab strip set the panel's width and a few tabs stretched it back to desktop width with the phone-sized grid stranded at the left edge. The width is stated; the chrome shrinks or scrolls inside it. Default mobile width is 450.
- **The pop-out's mobile toggle only did half its job** — its window resize was denied for want of `core:window:allow-set-size`, leaving the CSS constraint alone.
- **Editor preference changes discarded undo history** — `CodeEditor` now reconfigures font size, tab size and the line-number gutter through CodeMirror compartments instead of rebuilding the view.

---

## [0.3.3] — 2026-08-30

### Added
- **Real PTY terminal** — `src-tauri/src/pty.rs` spawns the actual login shell with `portable-pty` and runs terminal emulation host-side with the `vt100` crate; the renderer receives resolved cell grids over `pty://frame` and paints styled spans (`src/shell/Terminal/TerminalView.tsx`, `src/shell/Terminal/grid.ts`, `src/shell/Terminal/useCellMetrics.ts`, `src/bridge/pty.ts`). Real scrollback, SIGWINCH resize, bracketed paste, DECCKM arrows, control codes, 256-colour + truecolour, OSC window titles.
- **Root shell access** — a header toggle respawns the session through `pkexec`, falling back to `sudo -i`, so the OS collects the password and no credential passes through the app. Root sessions carry a red border and badge. New commands `view.toggleTerminal` (`Ctrl+``) and `view.terminalRoot`.
- **Explorer resize + collapse** — `src/shell/useSidebarLayout.ts` — drag handle between the pane and editor (180–640px, persisted), double-click to reset, snap-closed under 120px, keyboard control (arrows resize, Enter toggles, Home resets), `Ctrl+B` toggle, reveal button when collapsed.
- **Filesystem watching** — `src-tauri/src/watch.rs` implements `watch_path`/`unwatch_path` with `notify`, coalescing bursts over 120ms. The client half (`watchPath`, the `file:changed` subscription) had been wired up with no host command behind it, so the tree never noticed changes made outside the app.
- **Version-sync gate** — `scripts/check-version-sync.mjs` fails the build when `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and (on a tag) the git tag disagree. Wired into `ci.yml` and `release.yml`.

### Changed
- **xterm.js removed** — `@xterm/xterm` and `@xterm/addon-fit` are gone. The previous terminal was a simulated shell with seven hardcoded commands; there is no terminal emulator in the renderer any more.
- `src/version.ts` — `useAppVersion()` reads the version from the running binary via `getVersion()`; `APP_VERSION` (build-time `package.json`) is now a fallback only, so a stale `dist/` cannot misreport the version.
- `src/shell/TerminalPanel.tsx` — pop-out is a plain Tauri `WebviewWindow`; the Picture-in-Picture and `window.open` fallbacks (and their cwd-sync machinery) are gone, since the session lives host-side and needs no state handed across.

### Fixed
- **Updater: a phantom update is now impossible.** `tauri-action` writes `latest.json` from `tauri.conf.json`, not from the tag, so tagging `v0.3.3` without bumping that file ships a release *named* 0.3.3 that advertises 0.3.2 — clients update "successfully" and stay on the version they had. The version-sync gate stops that at build time; the client additionally refuses any manifest not strictly newer than the running binary; `src-tauri/src/update_env.rs` reports the install medium using `bundle_type()` (the same value `tauri-plugin-updater` keys off, so the two cannot disagree) and refuses to download when no installer can apply; and every install writes a receipt that `verifyPendingUpdate()` checks on the next boot, so a silent failure is reported instead of hidden.
- **Ghost documents after closing a tab** — `src/store/documents.ts` — every mutator spread `s.docs[id]` unguarded, so a debounced editor callback landing after a tab close resurrected a half-built document or crashed on `s.history[id].past`. `saveDocument` also marked clean from a pre-write snapshot, dropping edits made while the write was in flight. Closing a middle tab now focuses its neighbour rather than the last tab.
- **Explorer re-rendered on every store write** — `src/shell/SideBar.tsx` — the zustand selector returned a fresh object literal on every read, so the default `Object.is` comparison never matched.
- **`loadChildren` was called during render** — `src/shell/SideBar.tsx` — re-firing on every re-render while the request was in flight; moved to an effect.
- **Cross-directory folder copies rendered as files** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — `copyTo` looked the source entry up in the *destination's* listing.
- **`file:changed` refreshed the wrong directory** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — the ancestor walk computed its separator index once outside the loop and reused it as a slice length against a shrinking string, skipping levels.
- **Rows could spin forever** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — a stale-generation load returned early without clearing `loading`.
- **Terminal window remounted continuously** — `src/App.tsx` — `React.lazy()` inside the component body built a new lazy type on every render.
- **Whole document re-parsed on every keystroke** — `src/editor/CodeEditor/index.tsx` — the language compartment was keyed on `doc.raw`. Store-side changes (undo/redo, Revert File) also never reached the view; both CodeEditor and MarkdownEditor now adopt them.
- **Toast timers leaked past unmount** — `src/ui/Toast.tsx`.
- **`pasteInto` suffixed `" copy"` with no collision** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — the original name is kept when the destination is free.
- **Navigation discarded still-valid selections** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — `goUp`/`goBack`/`goForward` keep a selection that remains under the new root.
- **`develop.yml` never parsed** — `.github/workflows/develop.yml:98` had an unquoted `${{ }}` inside a YAML flow mapping, so every run of that workflow died at startup with "workflow file issue" and 0s duration, on `main` and release branches too.

---

## [0.3.2] — 2026-08-29

### Added
- **Red theme** — `src/theme/tokens.css:294` new `:root[data-theme="red"]` dark crimson theme (bg #1c0a0e, surfaces #260f13→#57202b, accent #ef5350) with WCAG-checked text/contrast pairs and per-theme syntax tokens; `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx:12` adds `red` to `ThemeId`/`resolved`/`ORDER`/`resolveTheme` (now 5 themes + system); `src/shell/TitleBar.tsx:25` adds `red` to the theme menu + 6th swatch (3×2 mini-grid now fills exactly); `src/shell/TitleBar.css:95` `.titlebar__swatch--red` #ef5350; `src/shell/WelcomeWizard.tsx:25` adds Red ("Crimson night") to the wizard's theme pick; `src/shell/WelcomeWizard.css:117` swatch preview; `src/lib/themeTokens.ts:43` registers `spark-red` (and the previously missing `spark-amber`) Shiki themes, `src/lib/shiki.ts:20` loads them and `highlight()` accepts `amber`/`red` (`HighlightThemeId`).
- **Splash screen rework** — `src/shell/SplashScreen.tsx` — stages now mirror the real boot sequence (assets → theme → IPC bridge → `state.json` → session restore → ready) with a `v{version}` meta line (`src/version.ts`, sourced from `package.json`); dismissal is gated on actual boot completion (`ready` prop from `App.tsx` boot effect), not a fake timer. Splash moved to the app root (covers the full window; `App.css` `.app` gains `position: relative`).
- **First-time setup** — `src/shell/Onboarding.tsx` + `Onboarding.css` — first-run empty state (welcome cards: New document / Open file… / Open folder…, recents list, palette hint) replacing the old `EmptyState`; `src/shell/WelcomeWizard.tsx` + `WelcomeWizard.css` — 3-step first-run wizard (intro → theme pick (applies live, all 5 themes) → ready), Esc skips, focus moves per step and is restored on close (A11Y-002); `src/shell/firstRun.ts` — `spark.onboarded` localStorage flag + `shouldShowWelcome()` gate (first run only when there are no recents and no docs open); new Help → "Show Welcome Screen" command (`help.welcome` → `spark:help:welcome`).
- **Loader** — `src/ui/Loader.tsx` — `LoaderOverlay` full-surface waiting state (spinner + message, blocking variant) for long-running host work; `prefers-reduced-motion` support in `Loader.css`.

### Changed
- `src/App.tsx` — boot effect sets `bootReady` (gates the splash) and opens the welcome wizard on first run instead of force-loading the sample document; `@version` alias added to `tsconfig.json` + `vite.config.ts`.

### Fixed
- **Updater: missing-platform errors no longer surface as "Update check failed"** — `src/bridge/updater.ts` — error classification extracted to `classifyUpdaterError()` (`no-release` / `no-platform` / `error`); the Tauri error `None of the fallback platforms ["linux-x86_64"] were found in the response 'platforms' object` (published `latest.json` had no Linux entry) is now treated as "No updates — No update available for this platform yet" in both silent and manual checks. Root cause on the release side: `.github/workflows/release.yml` ubuntu leg lacked `libfuse2` and used bundle target `all`, which can silently drop the AppImage updater artifact; now installs `libfuse2`, pins `--bundles appimage,deb` on Linux, and the `verify-ota` job fails the release if `latest.json` lacks `linux-x86_64`.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Terminal panel** — `src/shell/TerminalPanel.tsx:1` xterm.js (`@xterm/xterm@^6.0.0` + `@xterm/addon-fit@^0.11.0`) with `TerminalPanel.css:1`, cwd derived from explorer selection via `useTerminalCwd()` (selected → `targetCwd` → active doc → root → `/`), floating draggable panel + Document Picture-in-Picture / Tauri `WebviewWindow` / `window.open` pop-out (all OS-level windows, main stays interactive), `src/store/terminal.ts:1` Zustand `useTerminal` (`isOpen/targetCwd/openAt/toggle/setTargetCwd`) + `openTerminalAt(cwd)` / `closeTerminal()` imperative helpers (sync explorer selection + `spark:terminal:open` event), `src/shell/PluginRail.tsx:1` 44px hairline plugin rail left-of-explorer (`PluginRail.css:1`, `border-right: 1px solid var(--border)`) with extensible `PLUGINS` registry (first entry `terminal`), `src/App.tsx:278` `app__rail` layout + `isTerminalWindow()` / `TerminalStandalone` (lazy `TerminalStandaloneInner`, `terminal:?cwd=` query, `postMessage`/`storage`/`terminal:cwd` event sync) for true out-of-window hosting.
- **Explorer context menu** — `src/shell/ExplorerContextMenu.tsx:1` right-click / bubble menu (new file…, new folder…, open in terminal, reveal in OS, cut, copy, paste, rename…, refactor…, delete) filtered by `isDir` + `clipboard` state, rename + delete confirm dialogs (`Dialog`/`Input`/`Button`), `src/ui/ContextMenu.tsx:1` + `ContextMenu.css:1` Radix `ContextMenu` primitive (`ContextMenuEntry` type), `src/shell/SideBar.tsx:1` wires `ExplorerContextMenu` per-row + empty-area + bubble-menu `Open in Terminal` → `openTerminalAt(cwd)` (routes to in-app panel, no external spawn), `src/ui/Icon.tsx:68` new icon entries, `src/ui/Dropdown.tsx`/`Popover.tsx` polish, `src/shell/SideBar.css:1` + `src/App.css:1` rail refinements, `src/editor/SvgEditor/index.tsx:1` minor fixes.
- **Explorer store — clipboard & file ops** — `src/store/explorer.ts:45` adds `clipboard: ClipboardEntry|null` + `ClipboardOp = "copy"|"cut"` + actions `renamePath(path,newName)/moveTo(from,to)/deletePath(path)/copyTo(from,to)/setClipboard(entry)/pasteInto(targetDir)/openInTerminal(cwd)/revealInOS(path)/refactor(path,newName)` (refactor = rename for now, seam for future language-aware moves), eager cache remap for rename/move (parent listing rewrite, `children` key remap `path→to`, `expanded` set remap, `selectedPath` follow), `nextAvailableDest()` probes `stat()` for `name copy` / `name copy (N)` collision avoidance (1000 probes → timestamp fallback), `src/store/explorer.test.ts:1` 5 new tests: `createFile+renamePath updates cache+selection`, `createFolder+deletePath removes entry`, `setClipboard copy → pasteInto produces 'name copy'`, `cut → paste moves+clears clipboard`, `renamePath rejects path separators` (19 total green).
- **Host commands** — `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:191` new `#[tauri::command]`s: `rename(from,to)` (refuse if dest exists, `create_dir_all(parent)`), `delete(path)` (dir → `remove_dir_all`, else `remove_file`), `copy(from,to)` + `copy_dir_recursive(src,dst)` (refuse if dest exists, recursive dir copy), `open_in_terminal(cwd)` (macOS `open -a Terminal <cwd>`, Windows `cmd /C start cmd /K cd /d <cwd>`, Linux probe `x-terminal-emulator|gnome-terminal|konsole|alacritty|xterm` with `--working-directory` variants), `reveal_in_folder(path)` (`open -R` / `explorer /select,` / `xdg-open parent`), `open_with_os(path)` (`open` / `cmd /C start` / `xdg-open`), all registered in `invoke_handler` at `lib.rs:443`; `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json:5` adds `windows: ["main","terminal"]` + `core:window:allow-create|allow-set-focus|allow-show|allow-hide|core:webview:allow-create-webview*` permissions for pop-out windows.
- **Bridge** — `src/bridge/commands.ts:12` wraps `tInvoke` in `Load failed/custom protocol/callback id` fallback (`console.warn` + `mock()` so Vite dev without Tauri stays usable), new typed wrappers `copyPath/openInTerminal/revealInOS/openWithOS`, memory mocks for `rename` (prefix-rename `MEMORY_FS`/`MEMORY_DIRS` keys), `delete` (recursive prefix delete), `copy` (prefix copy), and no-ops for `open_in_terminal/reveal_in_folder/open_with_os`; `src/store/terminal.ts:1` re-exports `openTerminalAt`/`closeTerminal` for non-React callers.

### Changed
- **Deps** — `package.json:73` adds `@xterm/xterm@^6.0.0` + `@xterm/addon-fit@^0.11.0` (2308 insertions, 24 files). `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:28` `security.csp` → `null` (was `default-src 'self'…` — loosened for xterm `blob:`/inline styles in terminal panel; re-tighten before hardening).
- **CSP** — noted above; OTA `latest.json` endpoint unchanged (`https://github.com/blackswanalpha/spark-editor/releases/latest/download/latest.json`).

## [0.2.2] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Amber theme** — `src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx:12` adds `amber` to `ThemeId`/`ORDER`/`resolveTheme` (now `light|dark|navy|amber|system`, 5-way cycle), `src/theme/tokens.css:244` new `:root[data-theme="amber"]` warm light theme (bg #fffbeb, surfaces #fef3c7→#fcd34d, accent #d97706 amber, shadows warm, syntax warm), `src/shell/TitleBar.tsx:23` adds `amber` to `THEME_OPTIONS` + 5-swatch grid, `src/shell/TitleBar.css:70` `grid-template-columns: repeat(3,1fr)` 20×14 + `.titlebar__swatch--amber` #f59e0b. Selectable via TitleBar theme menu, persisted via `LazyStore`/`localStorage`, cycles via `cycle()` — test OTA via `Help → Check for Updates` after `0.2.2` release.

### Fixed
- **Merge PR #6 / develop workflow** — `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:71` pubkey corrected to single-line minisign format `dW50…` (was raw 32-byte `RWRa…` which failed `invalid utf-8 at index 5` on `cargo tauri build` with `createUpdaterArtifacts:true`); `src-tauri/Cargo.lock` synced (0.2.1→0.2.2). `.github/workflows/develop.yml:27` `ci` now `if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop' || pull_request || workflow_dispatch` (was triggering on `main` push and failing). `.github/workflows/release.yml:85` `verify-ota` now `uses: actions/checkout@v4` (was `not a git repository` + `latest.json not found`).

## [0.2.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed
- **OTA signing key** — previous `v0.2.0` key was generated without password and fails at build (`Missing comment in secret key`). Regenerated with password `spark-ota-2025`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:71` pubkey now `RWRaUWew/hvfdKkydjS7CiAtKLfGko9J9MNWe67IUqgn8RobeXHGPW0n` (id `74DF1BFEB067515A`, corrected to single-line `dW50…` in 0.2.2). `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` + `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD` secrets updated. Verified `cargo tauri signer sign` now succeeds.

### Added
- **Develop workflow** — `.github/workflows/develop.yml:1` — `develop` CI gate, `build-develop-artifact` (deb/AppImage for QA, `createUpdaterArtifacts:false`), and `cut-release` (`workflow_dispatch` → bumps `package.json`/`Cargo.toml`/`tauri.conf.json`, creates `release/*` branch + PR to `main`). `auto-bump` helper for patch/minor/major. See `gitflow.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-28

### Added
- **Launch & setup icons** — regenerated `src-tauri/icons/` via `cargo tauri icon` from `_master.png` (1024). Proper desktop assets: `32x32.png`, `64x64.png`, `128x128.png`, `128x128@2x.png` (256), `icon.png` (512), `icon.icns` (macOS, 64 KB), `icon.ico` (Windows). `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json:32` — `bundle.icon` updated, `publisher/category/shortDescription/longDescription` set, `createUpdaterArtifacts: true`, and `linux`/`windows`/`macOS` bundle targets wired so installers create correct desktop shortcuts / Start-Menu entries / `.desktop` files.
- **OTA updates** — `tauri-plugin-updater` (Rust `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:275` + `@tauri-apps/plugin-updater` JS) + `capabilities/{default,desktop}.json` (`updater:default`, `updater:allow-check`, `updater:allow-download-and-install`, `process:allow-restart`). New `src/bridge/updater.ts:1` (`checkForUpdates()`, `checkForUpdatesOnBoot()`) — silent boot check (4 s delay) and manual **Help → Check for Updates…** (`src/commands/registry.ts:336` + `src/App.tsx:229`). `tauri.conf.json:plugins.updater` pubkey `RWQ8g3GffHCTjah…krV` (now superseded in 0.2.1) and endpoint `https://github.com/blackswanalpha/spark-editor/releases/latest/download/latest.json`. CSP extended to GitHub.
- **File explorer** — `src/shell/SideBar.tsx` ports the designlab (`designlabs/labs/explorer.html`) to React. Lazy `read_dir` per directory, keyboard navigation (↑↓→← Enter Home End), toolbar (new file / refresh / collapse / show hidden), recents tab preserved, A11Y-004 tree-view contract.
- **Explorer store** — `src/store/explorer.ts` — zustand + immer, lazy `children` cache, `setRoot` / `toggleDir` / `refresh` / `collapseAll` / `setSelected` / `createFile` actions, `subscribeToFileChanges` wires host `file:changed` events to tree refresh.
- **Host commands** — `create_file(path, contents?)` (refuses to overwrite, returns `FileStat`) and `mkdir(path)` (`mkdir -p`, idempotent) added to `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`. Wrappers in `src/bridge/commands.ts`. Browser mocks in `MEMORY_FS` / `MEMORY_DIRS`. Docs: `docs/reference/host-commands.md`.
- **File-watcher bridge** — `watchPath` / `unwatchPath` typed wrappers and `onFileChanged` event subscriber in `src/bridge/{commands,events}.ts`. Browser mock returns a fake `WatchId` and a no-op unlisten.
- **New editor surfaces** — `src/editor/HtmlPreview/` (live HTML preview, `bundle.ts`) and `src/editor/SvgEditor/` (SVG canvas, `model.ts`).
- **Save flows** — `src/shell/SaveAsModal.tsx` + `src/shell/UnsavedChangesModal.tsx` (with `UnsavedChangesModal.test.tsx`, `documents.test.ts`), `src/store/documents.ts` `saveDocument`/`saveDocumentAs` + dirty guard, wired in `src/App.tsx` and `src/shell/SideBar`.
- **CodeEditor language map** — `src/editor/CodeEditor/languages.ts` expanded to cover JS/TS/Python/Markdown/CSS/Go/Rust/SQL/YAML/JSON/HTML with Shiki bridge (`highlightBridge.ts`), `CodeEditor.css` refinements.
- **UX polish** — `src/App.tsx` MenuBar integration + explorer root sync, `src/ui/Icon.tsx` / `DartIcon.tsx` / `LangLogo.tsx`, `src/shell/SideBar.css` refinements, `src/commands/registry.ts` help/docs/about/devtools.

### Changed
- **CodeEditor** — `src/editor/CodeEditor/index.tsx` lint fixes, language compartment wiring.
- **StatusBar** — `src/ui/StatusBar.tsx` minor alignment.
- **Tauri host** — `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` `read_file_base64` + `WriteReceipt`/`FileStat` handling updates.

### Fixed
- `src-tauri/icons/icon.icns` was a misnamed PNG (11 KB) — regenerated as proper ICNS (64 KB). `icon.ico` regenerated correctly.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-27

Initial public scaffolding. Usable in Vite (browser mock FS) and via Tauri when the Rust toolchain is present.

### Added
- **App shell** — `src/App.tsx:40` — `ThemeProvider` (light/dark/system) + `ToastProvider` + `SplashScreen` + custom `TitleBar` (`decorations: false`, `titleBarStyle: Overlay` on macOS) + `Tabs` + `SideBar` (recents) + `StatusBar` + `CommandPalette` with Framer Motion transitions.
- **Document store** — `src/store/documents.ts:50` — Zustand + Immer, `docs/order/active/history`, per-doc undo/redo (cap 100), `setRaw`/`setIr`/`setMode`/`setCursor`/`markClean`, cursor tracking.
- **Command registry** — `src/commands/registry.ts:26` — `buildCommands()` table consumed by palette, title-bar menu mirror, and global keybindings (`⌘/Ctrl+Shift+P`, `⌘/Ctrl+N/O/S/W/B/Z`).
- **Bridge** — `src/bridge/commands.ts:13` — typed `invoke()` wrappers (`read_file`, `write_file`, `read_dir`, `stat`, `recents_*`, `app_state_*`) with browser-only `MEMORY_FS` fallback (`welcome.md`, `notes.md`, `hello.ts`, `README.md`).
- **IR** — `src/ir/types.ts:14` — `Document { version: 1, blocks: Block[] }`, `Block` (paragraph/heading/blockquote/list/code/thematic/html), `Inline` marks, `ListItem`; stable `id` per node (`src/ir/ids.ts`).
- **Markdown surface** — `src/editor/MarkdownEditor/index.tsx:24` — CodeMirror 6 + `lang-markdown`, toolbar, `Compartment` theme, live preview via `renderMd.ts`.
- **Code surface** — `src/editor/CodeEditor/index.tsx:32` — CodeMirror 6 + gutter, `bracketMatching`, `foldGutter`, `highlightSelectionMatches`, language compartment (`js/ts/py/md`), Shiki-bridged `HighlightStyle` (`highlightBridge.ts`).
- **Rich surface** — `src/editor/RichEditor/index.tsx` — Tiptap StarterKit + lowlight code blocks, link extension.
- **Theming & motion** — `src/theme/` (`tokens.css`, `base.css`, `ThemeProvider.tsx`) + `src/motion/index.ts` (Framer Motion re-export).
- **UI primitives** — `src/ui/` — `Button`, `Dialog`, `Dropdown`, `Icon` (Phosphor), `Input`, `Kbd`, `Loader`, `Popover`, `StatusBar`, `Tabs`, `Toast` (Radix primitives).
- **Tauri host** — `src-tauri/src/lib.rs:38` — `HostError` (`NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`, `NotUtf8`, `IsADirectory`, `AlreadyExists`, `InvalidPath`, `Internal`) + commands `read_file`, `write_file` (returns `WriteReceipt`), `read_dir`, `stat`; plugins `dialog`, `fs`, `store`, `os`, `window-state`, `clipboard-manager`, `process`, `log`.
- **Config** — `vite.config.ts:7` (aliases `@ui/@shell/@ir/...`, port 1420/1421), `tsconfig.json` (strict), `tauri.conf.json:13` (1280×800, CSP `default-src 'self'`), `Cargo.toml:32` (release `lto`, `opt-level s`).
- **Documentation** — `README.md`, `explanation.md`, `description.md` (300 chars), `worklog.md`, `changelog/` (this file); `../docs/` (Diátaxis: tutorials/how-to/reference/explanation) + `../designlabs/` (static HTML prototypes + `verify_assets.py`).
- **Packaging** — `package.json:2` `spark-book@0.1.0`, scripts `dev/build/preview/typecheck/lint/test/tauri`.

### Known limitations
- File watcher (`notify` → `file:changed`) not yet wired; self-write suppression planned.
- Rich slash/floating menus staged in `designlabs` but not fully wired in `RichEditor`.
- Session restore (`app_data_dir/recents.json`, window geometry) — host commands exist, renderer boot wiring is best-effort.
- Single window, single user, local files only — no sync, no LSP/DAP, no collaboration (by design — see `explanation.md:7`).
